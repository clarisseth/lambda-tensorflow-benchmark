# Lambda Lab Deep Learning Benchmarks

Lambda Labs published a series of blogs at https://lambdalabs.com/blog which calculate training performance of a number of TensorFlow models by calculating the number of images per second processed. The following models are tested: 

| model | input size | param mem | feat. mem | flops  |
|-------|------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| resnet-50 | 224 x 224 | 98 MB | 103 MB | 4 BFLOPs |
| resnet-152 | 224 x 224 | 230 MB | 219 MB | 11 BFLOPs |
| inception-v3 | 299 x 299 | 91 MB | 89 MB | 6 BFLOPs |
| vgg-vd-19 | 224 x 224 | 548 MB | 63 MB | 20 BFLOPs |
| alexnet | 227 x 227 | 233 MB | 3 MB | 1.5 BFLOPs |
| ssd-300 | 300 x 300 | 100 MB | 116 MB | 31 GFLOPS |

This is the write-up to try out the Lambda Labs Deep Learning benchmarks on the MIT Satorti system:

https://mit-satori.github.io 

# To deploy on Satori do the following:

1. Get access to Satori following  instructions in the [Satori Documentation](https://mit-satori.github.io/satori-basics.html)
2. Point your browse to the [Satori Open On-Demand (OOD)  portal](https://satori-portal.mit.edu/pun/sys/dashboard)
3. On the top menu bar got to **Clusters -> Satori Shell Access** 
4. In the  shell get the test repo by typing: 
``` git clone https://github.com/clarisseth/lambda-tensorflow-benchmark.git --recursive ```
5. Once the git clone is done, go back to the OOD Dashboad window (labeld **My Interactive Sessions**) and go to menu option **Interactive Apps -> Jupyter Notebook**
6. Choose the **Anaconda.10 PowerAI [experimental]** module from the menu and click the **Launch** button to fire off a Jupyterlab session
7. Click the on **Host** node name button when it appears in a few moments.  This opens a terminal on the node.
8. If needed, Follow the instructions (https://mit-satori.github.io/satori-ai-frameworks.html) to activate your WML-CE environment for the first time or if not automatef
9. Find the git repo directory (**lambda-tensorflow-benchmark**) you downloaded in step 4. 
10. Edit run.sh for the number of iterations (1 iteration can take an hour) and GPUs (up to 4) and run the command: 
  ```./run.sh```
11. Output will be the number of runs completed and the geometric mean of the results (images/sec) from the *.log file. Detailed result of the runs will appear in the ./lambda-tensorflow-benchmark/POWER9-*.logs sub-directory 

The models that are run in these all inclusive scripts are actually the standard TensorFlow benchmarks found at https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks
You can also find them and more in your active WML-CE environment on Satori. For e.g.

```
 cd ./$HOME2/anaconda3/envs/wmlce-1.6.2/tf_cnn_benchmarks/
 python tf_cnn_benchmarks.py --help
```

Each of the seven models in the Lambda Labs test suite is run with precision (FP32 and FP16), and with two weight update setting (variable_update=parameter_server and replicated) for a total of 28 results per iteration.


The instructions above was tested in the interactive MIT Satori Environment:

- Red Hat version: 7.6
- WML-CE version: 1.6.2
- TensorFlow version: 1.15
- CUDA Version 10.1
- CUDNN Version 7.6.0.3

The **./collect_sys_info.sh**  included here is a handy script to keep track of your environment. Good Luck!


# Additional details of what run.sh does:

This is the code used for a few of the blog posts on: https://lambdalabs.com/blog including:

- 2080 Ti Deep Learning Benchmarks: https://lambdalabs.com/blog/2080-ti-deep-learning-benchmarks/


<!-- #### Step One: Download mini imagenet data (1.5 GB)


```
(mkdir ~/data;
curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lambdalabs-files/imagenet_mini.tar.gz | tar xvz -C ~/data)
``` -->

#### Step One: Clone benchmark repo


```
git clone https://github.com/lambdal/lambda-tensorflow-benchmark.git --recursive
```

#### Step Two: Run benchmark

* Input proper gpu_indices (a comma seperated list, default 0) and num_iterations (default 10)
```
cd lambda-tensorflow-benchmark
./benchmark.sh gpu_indices num_iterations
```

#### Step Three: Report results

* Check the repo directory for folder \<cpu>-\<gpu>.logs (generated by benchmark.sh)
* Use the same num_iterations and gpu_indices for both benchmarking and reporting.
```
./report.sh <cpu>-<gpu>.logs num_iterations gpu_indices
```
